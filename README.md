# Study Buddy

This started out as Flash Cards to study design patterns.

Flash Cards could be used to study the design patterns, but could also be used to study for Certification Exams, and the acronyms.

There was also a need to study Blazor, and many other things. In addition there was a need to demonstrate current skills.

Instead, I decided to repurpose the whole project, and make it the Study Buddy.

## Learning / Teaching Opportunity
There are several issues with the FlashCardsUI, including the name. But it was a great proof of concept on what else needed done for it to work the way I want.

Some of these items are listed below. But they will take time. I am mentoring a few junior developers. And during development is a great time to document, and teach document the items as they are being implemented.

It demonstrates not only "How" to do something, but why it "should" be done, and often "needs" to be done.

## When deployed
The site will be available [here](https://mariekauth.github.io/StudyBuddy/) after first deployment. 

Currently there is an issue with the deployment. The media files including .css are unable to load likely due to a security issue with http versus https. We are currently working on it.
